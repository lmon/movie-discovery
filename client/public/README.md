This project was bootstrapped with:
    Create React App & Bootstrap Css for the client.

    I hope that is not a problem as I figured the point of this excercise, based on the requirements, was to demonstrate a 'full-stack' capability, rather than the ability to create everything from scratch. (I hope I am correct!)

    To that point this is not a Production-ready App(!). Mostly there is work to do on rendering optimization, and as mentioned as one extra, caching.

    I added the following extras:
        - Some design basics: I simply tried to make the app clear and usable with Bootstrap.
        - Related Movies
