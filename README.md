Hello!
This project was bootstrapped with the `Create React App` & Bootstrap Css for the client.

I hope that is not a problem as I figured the point of this excercise, based on the requirements, was to demonstrate a 'full-stack' capability, rather than the ability to create everything from scratch. (I hope I am correct!)

To that point this is not a Production-ready App(!). Mostly there is work to do on rendering optimization, webpack/babel futzing, and as mentioned as one extra, caching. As well you will see I did not utilize Redux or similar for state management, as that seemed, again, like more hoops that you were not interested in.

    I added the following extras:
        - Some design basics: I simply tried to make the app clear and usable with Bootstrap.
        - Related Movies
        - Unit tests with Jest

## How to Install and Run

In the <root> directory install dependencies for the server with
`npm install`
then
`npm start`

In the <root>/client directory install dependencies for the client with
`npm install`
then
`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Thank You!
